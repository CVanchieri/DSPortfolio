Misfits are a fun unique 2 part character series digital-art NFT collection.  

Part 1 of the Misfits collection includes the Misfit heads, there will only ever be 50 Misfits heads created and each piece is unique and one of a kind.  Part 2 of the series is the full Misfits character, each Misfits head will have a unique Misfits body designed and created specifically for it.

This will involve size, shape, color, clothes, accessories, anything that has to do with the character body can be discussed.  If the Misfit head is not owned or the owner does not wish to give input, a unique Misfits body will be designed for the Misfit head and sold to the public.  The full characters of the Misfits will be released on December 3rd 2021, those that own a Misfits head on this date will be given 72hrs to purchase the full Misfits character that represents their Misfits head, after 72hrs the full Misfits character will be open to the public for sale.
