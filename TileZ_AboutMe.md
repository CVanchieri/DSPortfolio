### Aspiring Data Scientist trying to make a positive impact on others health & wellness and the environment.
 My name is Charles Vanchieri and for the past 13 years I have been working in the health & wellness industry both corporate and privately in many different deparments.  Health & wellness was always natural and second nature for me, and so with a few great opportunities that is where I began my professional career in 2008.  I have always had a passion for technology and a desire to get involved with programming and software developement. In early 2019 I decided I was going to pursue a career change and get involved with datasScience by enrolling in Lambda School's part-time data science program. 
 
This webiste is a collection of data science projects, interests, notes and ideas that I have come across along this new journey.
