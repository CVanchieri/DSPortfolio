## Visualizing the COVID-19 virus in a matplotlib barchart race.


With a little more downtime during the lockdown I decided to see if I could make one of these bar chart races I have seen.  With COVID-19 
being such a hot topic I figured that finding and API to pull some good data from shouldn't be to tough so thats how the project began, a bar chart race on 
COVID-19.  I was not sure how or which programs or libraries were used to create this type of graph, not surprising there are a few out there.  
I found a couple websites that would generate a bar chart race with the right data, but I was more interested in the full development being all 
in Python, to my surprise I found that Matplotlib was a capable source and so it was an easy decision to try something new that I was not considering 
an option.

#### Summary
I had seen a few of these bar chart race graphs floating around but I was unsure of what programs or libraries that were necessary 
to create one.  I was surprised to find out that Matplotlib was a resource for this type of animated graph, I was under the impression
that Matplotlib was a more basic visualization library and I did not consider this 'basic' looking.  My overall take away was that 
Matplotlib is more creative and useful than I had first thought, the graph is fun to look and it wasn't a big pain to put together either 
surprisingly.  If you have overlooked Matplotlib I'd consider digging into a little bit there are some gems hidden in there.

Any suggestions or feedback is greatly appreciated, I am still learning and am always open to suggestions and comments. <br>
