## A website to teach middle school students about the Earth through data visualizations with interative lessons.
This group project's team consisted of 3 data scientists and 2 web developers.  The idea came to us because we had all experienced how the majority of data visualization sites are targeted towards a general older population or those in that field of interest.  We saw an opportunity to teach younger students about environmental issues and data visualizations by creating a website that is targeted towards these younger ages that is more interactive and engaging for them.  The DS teams focus was sourcing, aggregating, and pushing the manipulated data to the web team with a few data visualization mock up ideas to go with each data set provided to web.  The tools used by the DS team was AWS, Docker, Postman, Flask, Heroku, PostgreSQL, all developed in Python.  There were 2 visualizations that included predictions and the predictive models used were, Facebook Prophet and a Random Forest Regressor.  There was a 6 week time period given to work on the project, there is no 'finished' or 'complete' for the project as there will be future groups that will keep adding and working on the project, it is on going.

#### Summary
This was my first group project that worked and collaborated directly with othe teams.  With great communication the team collaborated and really worked well together to produced a great project that will be a solid foundation for other groups to take over and keep adding more to the site.  Overall the experience was a good one, I learned new processes about AWS backend services that will really help me out in future and working with the web team was very informative about how web backend and front not only work but how they interact with they can interact with a data science team.  There was much more involved in this website than the visualizations above, the link below will take you the the live website and the websites github repository.

Any suggestions or feedback is greatly appreciated, I am still learning and am always open to suggestions and comments. <br>
