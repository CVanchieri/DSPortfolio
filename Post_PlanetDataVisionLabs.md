## A website to teach middle school students about the Earth and data visualizations with interative lessons.
This website was a group prject, the team consisted of 3 data scientist and 2 web developers.  We saw an opportunity to teach young students about the earth through interactive data visualizations giving them a mild introduction to data visualzation as well.  The ds teams focus was sourcing, aggregating, and pushing the manipulated data to the web team with a few data visualization mock up ideas to go with the data.  The tools used by the ds team was AWS, Docker, Postman, Flask, Heroku, PostgreSQL, all developed in Python.  There were 2 visualizations that included predictions and the predictive models used were, Facebook Prophet and a Random Forest Regressor.  There was a 6 week time period given to work on the project, there is no 'finished' or 'complete' for the project as there will be future groups that will keep adding and working on the project, it is on going.

#### Summary
This was my first group project that worked directly with othe teams.  With great communication the team collaborated and really worked well together to produced a great project that will be a solid foundation for other groups to take over and keep adding more to the site.  Overall the experience was a good one, I learned new processes about AWS backend services that will really help me out in future and working with the web team was very informative about how web backend and front not only work but how they interact with they can interact with a data science team.  There was much more involved in this website than the visualizations above, the link below will take you the the live website and the websites github repository.

Any suggestions or feedback is greatly appreciated, I am still learning and am always open to suggestions and comments. <br>
